  <summary><b>Zachary Whiddon</b><br>Structural remodeling of peripheral taste neurons is fast and independent of taste cell turnover</summary>

<p>Aaron McGee, Robin Krimm</p>
<p>Taste receptor cells are constantly replaced in taste buds as old cells die and new cells migrate in from a pool of progenitors at the base of each bud. The perception of taste relies on new receptor cells integrating with existing neural circuitry, yet how these new cells connect with a taste neuron is unknown. Do taste neurons seek out new taste cells in the bud? Or is the axonal arbor of taste neurons fixed and taste cells migrate to replace older cells or contact the axon at a new location? We measured the motility and branching of individual taste receptive arbors, the portion of the axon innervating taste buds, over time with two-photon in vivo microscopy. Terminal branches of taste receptive arbors continuously and rapidly remodel within the taste bud. This remodeling is faster than predicted by taste bud cell renewal. However, taste receptive arbors did enter a new taste bud in longitudinal imaging studies lasting 100 days. Surprisingly, ablating new taste cells with chemotherapeutic agents revealed that remodeling of the terminal branches of taste receptive arbors does not rely of the renewal of taste bud cells. Thus, taste buds are innervated by a stable number of taste neurons that are constantly remodeling their branching patterns independent of taste cell turnover. This axonal structural plasticity provides a mechanism for the continuity of function for taste neurons.</p>

  <summary><b>Joshua Carlson</b><br>Study of putative cAMP effectors in Trypanosoma cruzi</summary>

<p>Aqsa Raja, Miguel Chiurillo, and Noelia Lander (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati)</p>
<p>Chagas disease is endemic in the Americas where it affects 8 million people, with no vaccines or effective treatments for the chronic phase of the disease. Its etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle, involving a mammalian host and an insect vector. In response to microenvironmental changes, T. cruzi differentiates into four developmental forms. Signaling cascades, including the cAMP pathway, sense these changes and trigger parasite differentiation. Canonical cAMP effectors are either absent or cAMP unresponsive in trypanosomes. Studying putative cAMP effectors is crucial to elucidate the role of this pathway in environmental sensing. In this study we are investigating the role of four putative cAMP effectors in T. cruzi: cAMP response proteins 1 and 3 (CARP1, CARP3), a regulatory subunit of Protein Kinase A-like protein (PKAr-like), and Flagellar Membrane Protein 6 (FLAM6). Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology we generated mutant cell lines where each protein was endogenously tagged, and CARPs were knocked out. Gene editing and protein expression was verified by PCR and western blot, while localization was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Further characterization of mutants is currently in progress. Our results will provide key information on the possible role of cAMP effectors in trypanosomes.</p>

  <summary><b>Lauren R. Brunner</b><br>Letâ€™s get physical: Physical Enrichment Alters Male Mouse Perception of Courtship Rejection Vocalizations</summary>

<p>Aejah M. Van Dyke, Tuskegee University; Dr. Laura M. Hurley, Indiana University</p>
<p>Both sensory and motor environmental enrichment (EE) are often employed in laboratory settings in order to improve animal welfare through promoting more naturalistically complex environments. However, few studies have explored the effects of EE on social communication. Here, we evaluate the effects of both social and physical enrichment on the perception of negatively valenced vocal signals in male house mice. During courtship interactions, female mice produce broadband vocalizations (BBVs, or squeaks), which can be associated with courtship rejection. Male mice produce prosocial USVs in courtship interactions and decrease their USV output in response to BBV playback. In this study, we used a 2x2 experimental design in which mice were either in social housing (S+) or isolated housing (S-), and either physically enriched housing (P+), or physically deprived housing (P-) for four weeks, creating four distinct groups with varying levels of social and physical enrichment: S+P+, S+P-, S-P+, and S-P-. Mice then underwent a split cage paradigm in which limited contact with a female mouse was allowed through a plexiglass barrier for fifteen minutes during which they were exposed to 5 minutes of silence (baseline), 5 minutes of BBV playback, and another 5 minutes of silence (recovery). USV production was measured to gauge perception of the BBVs. There was a significant effect of both social and physical enrichment level on baseline USV production, with P+ increasing and S+ decreasing baseline USV production. Mice exposed to physical enrichment, regardless of their social enrichment level, also produced significantly longer USVs than physically deprived mice. Physical enrichment also altered mouse perception of courtship rejection signals and the trajectory of vocal behavior during and after BBV playback, with P+ causing a decreased response to playback and decreased recovery after playback. Surprisingly, social treatment did not significantly affect these measurements, suggesting that physical enrichment powerfully alters mouse perception and vocal production in a social interaction, while social enrichment alone does not.</p>

  <summary><b>Michaela Rogers</b><br>Paternal exposure to novel predator cues reduces offspring survival in threespined stickleback</summary>

<p>Jennifer Hellmann</p>
<p>Climate change induces rapid changes to the environment such as introducing invasive species. Organisms can cope through transgenerational plasticity (TGP), occurring when parental experiences influence offspring phenotypes. TGP can prime offspring for future environments, but it is less known how parents use sensory cues to detect environmental shifts (i.e. increased predation). Individuals may rely on one cue (e.g. visual, olfactory) or use different cues simultaneously. I exposed threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) males to cues of a novel trout predator prior to fertilization for 10 days. I examined paternal behavior pre and post-exposure, and measured MHC expression with qPCR. MHC expression can reflect condition: sticklebacks with high MHC expression have worse condition and more stress. I generated offspring after the last exposure with IVF and tested them for antipredator behavior and survival against a live predator. Fathers exposed to visual cues oriented more to and spent time closer to the novel predator post-exposure on day one; MHC analysis is ongoing. Further, offspring survival decreased if fathers received visual cues. The visual cue was the only cue to elicit a change in paternal behavior and have a transgenerational effect on offspring, suggesting its importance for the recognition of novel predators in sticklebacks.</p>

  <summary><b>Jenny Yi-Ting Sung</b><br>Where, when, and who to court: ecological interactions and facial diversification of four species of syntopic paradise jumping spiders</summary>

<p>David J. Morris, University of Cincinnati; David Outomuro, University of Pittsburgh; Nathan I. Morehouse, University of Cincinnati</p>
<p>During courtship, animals face the challenge of communicating their identity or status to the appropriate audience, e.g., viable, receptive mates. The costs of being misidentified can often be high, ranging from wasted energy and reproductive resources to loss of life, as seen in precopulatory sexual cannibalism in spiders. So what traits do animals rely on to communicate their species identity? In paradise jumping spiders (genus /Habronattus/), males flaunt colorful and distinctive species-specific facial patterns. We hypothesized that male /Habronattus/ faces may contribute to communicating species identity, and these faces may have diversified in response to reinforcement selection. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal niche partitioning and male facial patterns of 4 syntopic /Habronattus/ species. We predicted that species with less niche partitioning (i.e., higher likelihood of interspecific interactions) would exhibit greater divergence in male facial patterns. First, we evaluated niche partitioning by quantifying habitat usage, spatiotemporal distribution and overlap, and interactions of spiders at the Edge of Appalachia Nature Preserve, Ohio. Next, we quantified spider facial patterns using hyperspectral imaging techniques. Lastly, we examined the relationship between spatiotemporal niche partitioning and facial pattern divergence. We discuss the results in the context of likely ecological and behavioral reproductive isolation in this syntopic community.</p>

  <summary><b>Aaron Hamrick</b><br>Olfactory Differences Among Closely Related Cactophilic Drosophila Species</summary>

<p>Stephanie M. Rollmann and John E. Layne</p>
<p>Evolutionary divergence of behavioral traits during adaptation to changes in the environment has been well documented in many animals. This divergence is often manifested in sensory systems, for instance, changes in the available host plants leads to shifts in behavioral preference of the insects that exploit them, and changes in the olfactory system that the insects use to identify and locate them. Some progress has been made in understanding the neural basis of such sensory modifications, both within and between Drosophila species. Shifts in host plants have been shown to correspond with changes in the sensitivity and selectivity of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to odor cues and/or changes in the number of select subtypes of OSNs. However, the extent to which such changes are lineage-specific, and thus due more to ancestry than to adaptation, remains to be determined. This research examines odorant responses by OSNs in six closely related pairs of Drosophila species from the Drosophila repleta group that feed and breed on cactus. Results indicate marked differences in neurophysiological response from several study species who have shifted host plant preference from the ancestral cactus â€“ prickly pear â€“ to columnar cactus, or to both the ancestral and new type of cactus, i.e., they have become polymorphic.</p>

  <summary><b>Tim Elmo Feiten</b><br>What Role does the Concept of Umwelt play in Sensory Ecology?</summary>

<p></p>
<p>Jakob von UexkÃ¼ll (1864 â€“ 1944) coined the concept of Umwelt to talk about the different worlds experienced by animals according to their specific sensory and motor capabilites. He had an important influence on ethology, partly through the work of Konrad Lorenz, and the term Umwelt is still used today in some fields of biology. I want to find out two things: a) How prevalent is the term Umwelt among sensory ecologists today and what do they take it to mean? b) What role does the subjective experience of animals play for sensory ecology in general? My poster poses these two questions to the scientists present at Sensorium 2022 and serves as a general invitation for dialogue about the status of subjective experience in the study of behavior, sensation, and environments. To provide some more structure for possible conversations, the poster summarizes two main lines of historical disagreement about UexkÃ¼llâ€™s thought: Do Umwelten belong to individual organisms or to entire species? And is an Umwelt selected from a larger set of pre-existing elements or is it actively constructed by the living subject?</p>

  <summary><b>Sanjay Prasher</b><br>Exploring the factors underlying social competency in foragers using an agent-based model</summary>

<p>Elizabeth A. Hobson, University of Cincinnati</p>
<p>Social connectedness allows animals to benefit from conspecifics (e.g., by gaining valuable information from knowledgeable individuals). Socially competent animals should affiliate more with informed individuals to increase the chances of benefiting from their activity. We used an agent-based model to evaluate how access to a food resource impacts an informed agentâ€™s social centrality when conspecifics have varying degrees of social competence. We modeled foraging on a food patch, which only an informed individual can activate, and tested how attention (probability of perceiving successful foragers), preference (probability of approaching successful foragers), and memory (number of time steps remembered) affected foraging success. To understand whether these parameters may underlie social competency, we compared the foraging success of non-producers and the producerâ€™s strength in a proximity network between simulations with different combinations of parameter values. This modeling approach will serve as a useful tool in understanding the potential cognitive mechanisms underlying social competency and producing predictions for empirical work.</p>

  <summary><b>Robert Lundy</b><br>Central Amygdala Somatostatin Expressing Neurons Projecting to NST are GABAergic</summary>

<p>Jane Bartonjo</p>
<p>The nucleus of solitary tract (NST) and parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent the first and second central synapses of ascending gustatory information. Neural processing in these nuclei is influenced by descending input from forebrain regions such as the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In mice, we have shown that somatostatin (Sst) expressing neurons of CeA (CeA/Sst) that project to NST and PBN are largely distinct cell populations and optogenetic inhibition of the CeA/Sst-to-NST subpopulation increases the intake of high concentrations of quinine, a taste stimulus that is usually considered aversive. The synaptic connectivity of this cell population is required to understand the possible mechanisms underlying these behavioral responses. Our lab has previously demonstrated that CeA/Sst terminals within the PBN expressed GABA and made synaptic contacts, largely, with non-GABAergic neural elements. To determine whether CeA/Sst terminals within the NST also express GABA, we used electron microscopy combined with cre-dependent anterograde transported virus injections (AAV9-DIO-dApex2) into the CeA of Sst-cre mice and post-embedding immunogold labelling for GABA. We found that majority of CeA/Sst terminals in NST express GABA and synapsed with non-GABAergic neural targets. These results suggest that CeA/Sst cells provide monosynaptic input to second order NST projection neurons (non-GABAergic) and this direct feedback inhibition is necessary for appropriate responding to bitter taste quality.</p>

  <summary><b>Amartya Tashi Mitra</b><br>Exploring the architecture of a complex lens</summary>

<p>Shubham Rathore; Elke Buschbeck (University of Cincinnati)</p>
<p>One of the most important features of eyes are lenses, structures which focus light precisely onto the retina. The process of lens development is well documented in vertebrates, in which the lens is a cellular structure that grows in layers. However, even though morphologically similar, insect lenses are made of secreted proteins, and how these are integrated to form a functional lens remains relatievely unexplored. To investigate how specific lens proteins contribute to accurate lens construction, we used RNAi to knock down lens3, a key lens protein of the visually guided predatory larvae of sunburst diving beetles, Thermonectus marmoratus. These are the only known extant organism with bifocal lenses, and lens3 is known to be expressed in lens producing cells. Knock-downs lead to cataract-like opacities, as well as deformities in lens architecture which we assess at the ultrasctructural level. Based on optical asessments we find that loss of lens3 affects the sharpness of images produced by isolted lenses, as well as the focusing capabilities of intact larval eyes. Ongoing behavioural studies further asess the potential impact on hunting success. This study represents a first step towards understanding how a complex insect lens is formed to support well-focusing eyes.</p>

  <summary><b>Deniz Korman</b><br>Stereopsis in a miniature world: Modeling the potential for stereopsis in hunting spiders</summary>

<p>Nathan I. Morehouse</p>
<p>The ability to perceive the spatial structure of one's environment is an integral part of vision. As such, most sighted animals possess the ability to extract depth information via their eyes. Yet, our understanding of depth perception is mostly limited to vertebrate, and largely primate systems. Hunting spiders present an opportune system to expand our understanding of depth perception to invertebrates. Equipped with 4 pairs of camera eyes and unmatched spatial resolution for animals their size, hunting spiders can navigate 3D environments, plan detours, and catch prey from a distance with precise lunges. These behaviors require acute spatial information, but we know very little about how these spiders perceive depth. In particular, the use of stereopsis by hunting spiders has been largely dismissed; their closely-positioned eyes (<< 1cm separation) are assumed to limit the utility of binocular disparity. However, binocular disparity is dictated by viewing distance, as well as eye separation, and the common dismissal fails to account for the short distances at which these miniature animals interact with their environment. We modeled the binocular disparity between eye-pairs of different hunting spider families viewing targets at behaviorally relevant distances. Our results indicated that some spider species have visual systems that allow them to utilize stereopsis and obtain precise depth information, whereas others do not have high enough acuity to detect small disparities. In fact, the binocular disparities for the stereoscopic species were comparable to those of toads, another non-primate system known to utilize stereopsis. This is a first step in our ongoing efforts to explain depth perception across hunting spiders through morphological and behavioral studies.</p>

  <summary><b>Michael Meece</b><br>Exploring specific infrared light wavelengths for neural recovery</summary>

<p>Elke Buschbeck, Thiane Thiam, Ngozi Okeke</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that long-wavelength light in the near-infrared to infrared range can promote healing of damaged tissue. While poorly understood, this is likely mediated by modulation of metabolic activity relating to the rate of ATP production. Retinal degeneration and recovery are powerful models in which to study this phenomenon. Biochemical assays have shown that 810 nm and 950 nm light can increase or decrease the production rate of ATP respectively. However, the impact of these wavelengths on retinal health has not been assessed. We investigated the recovery of the retina in White (w1118) mutant Drosophila melanogaster following a regime of light-induced damage and subsequent repeated exposure to either 810 nm or 950 nm light. Retinal health was examined electrophysiologically via electroretinography and by investigating the retinal ultrastructure. We found that 810 nm light promoted retinal recovery, whereas 950 nm light impeded recovery. These findings are consistent with previous implications about the importance of ATP in the recovery of damaged tissues and highlight how modulation with highly specific wavelength bands can have very different effects on neural health.</p>
