  <summary><b>Poster 1: Michael Meece</b><br>Exploring specific infrared light wavelengths for neural recovery</summary>

<p>Elke Buschbeck, Thiane Thiam, Ngozi Okeke</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that long-wavelength light in the near-infrared to infrared range can promote healing of damaged tissue. While poorly understood, this is likely mediated by modulation of metabolic activity relating to the rate of ATP production. Retinal degeneration and recovery are powerful models in which to study this phenomenon. Biochemical assays have shown that 810 nm and 950 nm light can increase or decrease the production rate of ATP respectively. However, the impact of these wavelengths on retinal health has not been assessed. We investigated the recovery of the retina in White (w1118) mutant Drosophila melanogaster following a regime of light-induced damage and subsequent repeated exposure to either 810 nm or 950 nm light. Retinal health was examined electrophysiologically via electroretinography and by investigating the retinal ultrastructure. We found that 810 nm light promoted retinal recovery, whereas 950 nm light impeded recovery. These findings are consistent with previous implications about the importance of ATP in the recovery of damaged tissues and highlight how modulation with highly specific wavelength bands can have very different effects on neural health.</p>

<p>Across sensory modalities, the segregation of distinct features of the sensory environment into parallel streams of information has proven a fundamental organizing principle. In the pulvinar nucleus (PUL), extensive reciprocal connections with most visual cortical areas and a lack of clearly defined cell types have made it difficult to link its anatomical organization with functional response properties. However, study of the projections from the superior colliculus (SC) to the PUL can provide a starting point for deciphering how anatomically defined components may be differentially involved in the various functions ascribed to the PUL. Using confocal microscopy, we observed a region occupying the caudal medial PUL that received highly convergent, bilateral projections from SC, whereas a region occupying the lateral PUL received only ipsilateral, topographically organized inputs from SC. Additionally, inputs to these anatomically defined regions showed a high degree of convergence with inputs from both layer 5 and layer 6 cortical neurons and displayed unique short term synaptic plasticity. Our results indicate a surprising level of convergence across anatomically defined PUL regions, highlighting its importance in integrating a diversity of visual information.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 25: Jenny Yi-Ting Sung</b><br>Where, when, and who to court: ecological interactions and facial diversification of four species of syntopic paradise jumping spiders</summary>

<p>David J. Morris, University of Cincinnati; David Outomuro, University of Pittsburgh; Nathan I. Morehouse, University of Cincinnati</p>
<p>During courtship, animals face the challenge of communicating their identity or status to the appropriate audience, e.g., viable, receptive mates. The costs of being misidentified can often be high, ranging from wasted energy and reproductive resources to loss of life, as seen in precopulatory sexual cannibalism in spiders. So what traits do animals rely on to communicate their species identity? In paradise jumping spiders (genus /Habronattus/), males flaunt colorful and distinctive species-specific facial patterns. We hypothesized that male /Habronattus/ faces may contribute to communicating species identity, and these faces may have diversified in response to reinforcement selection. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal niche partitioning and male facial patterns of 4 syntopic /Habronattus/ species. We predicted that species with less niche partitioning (i.e., higher likelihood of interspecific interactions) would exhibit greater divergence in male facial patterns. First, we evaluated niche partitioning by quantifying habitat usage, spatiotemporal distribution and overlap, and interactions of spiders at the Edge of Appalachia Nature Preserve, Ohio. Next, we quantified spider facial patterns using hyperspectral imaging techniques. Lastly, we examined the relationship between spatiotemporal niche partitioning and facial pattern divergence. We discuss the results in the context of likely ecological and behavioral reproductive isolation in this syntopic community.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 23: Zachary Whiddon</b><br>Structural remodeling of peripheral taste neurons is fast and independent of taste cell turnover</summary>

<p>Aaron McGee, Robin Krimm</p>
<p>Taste receptor cells are constantly replaced in taste buds as old cells die and new cells migrate in from a pool of progenitors at the base of each bud. The perception of taste relies on new receptor cells integrating with existing neural circuitry, yet how these new cells connect with a taste neuron is unknown. Do taste neurons seek out new taste cells in the bud? Or is the axonal arbor of taste neurons fixed and taste cells migrate to replace older cells or contact the axon at a new location? We measured the motility and branching of individual taste receptive arbors, the portion of the axon innervating taste buds, over time with two-photon in vivo microscopy. Terminal branches of taste receptive arbors continuously and rapidly remodel within the taste bud. This remodeling is faster than predicted by taste bud cell renewal. However, taste receptive arbors did enter a new taste bud in longitudinal imaging studies lasting 100 days. Surprisingly, ablating new taste cells with chemotherapeutic agents revealed that remodeling of the terminal branches of taste receptive arbors does not rely of the renewal of taste bud cells. Thus, taste buds are innervated by a stable number of taste neurons that are constantly remodeling their branching patterns independent of taste cell turnover. This axonal structural plasticity provides a mechanism for the continuity of function for taste neurons.</p>

<p>Transfer RNA (tRNA) bring the amino acid to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Chemical modifications to tRNA are required for proper functioning and accurate translation of messenger RNA codons. Modification to the anticodon influences decoding of codons by the tRNA and thus directly affects protein synthesis. Queuosine (Q) is an anticodon modification required for decoding codons of four amino acids. Q is synthesized in bacteria and eukaryotes have enzymes to salvage it from their microbiome. In mosquitoes, the microbiome affects immune response, environmental changes, and reproduction. Given mosquitoes are unable to synthesize Q, we hypothesized that the microbiome is critical to the maintenance of Q levels. Here, we show that growth of mosquito larvae with a microbiome of only E. coli lacking Q (∆queA) leads to lower Q levels in larval tRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are phenotypic effects on the coloration of ∆queA larvae. Lower Q levels correlate with less pigmentation and likely melanin which is critical to mosquito physiology. Lastly, we evaluate the effects on predation of mosquito larvae by the sunburst diving beetle (Thermonectus marmoratus). Overall, we show that the microbiome composition affects tRNA modification levels which affects phenotypes that alter predation of mosquito larvae.</p>

<p>Metabolism is a network of biochemical reactions that occurs in all organisms. It is necessary to produce the energy and metabolites required by living organisms for biological functions. However, how metabolic activity affects or regulates cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell reprogramming is not entirely understood. Here, we characterized the reprogramming of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) using RPE explants collected from chicken embryos. RPE is a plastic tissue capable of reprogramming into the retina in the presence of FGF2. Using RNAseq, we found that glycolysis genes were upregulated during reprogramming along with cell proliferation and neural genes. In contrast, RPE-related genes were downregulated in the presence of FGF2, indicating that RPE cells had lost their identity. By manipulating the cell media composition, we found that glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate are carbon sources that can be used by the RPE to be able to reprogram. Glycolysis inhibition blocks RPE reprogramming independently of the carbon source, indicating a requirement of this pathway for RPE reprogramming. Interestingly, induction of oxidative metabolism (OXPHOX) by activation of PDH, promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program that is FGF2 dependent. Supplementation of the medium with N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), partially redirects RPE to a neural fate when OXPHOX is activated, suggesting OXPHOX might produce an oxidative environment that promotes RPE reprogramming into mesenchyme fate. These findings provide evidence of how metabolism affects the cellular fate of plastic tissues such as RPE. In addition, our results might contribute to understanding RPE-related diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 17: Deniz Korman</b><br>Stereopsis in a miniature world: Modeling the potential for stereopsis in hunting spiders</summary>

<p>Nathan I. Morehouse</p>
<p>The ability to perceive the spatial structure of one's environment is an integral part of vision. As such, most sighted animals possess the ability to extract depth information via their eyes. Yet, our understanding of depth perception is mostly limited to vertebrate, and largely primate systems. Hunting spiders present an opportune system to expand our understanding of depth perception to invertebrates. Equipped with 4 pairs of camera eyes and unmatched spatial resolution for animals their size, hunting spiders can navigate 3D environments, plan detours, and catch prey from a distance with precise lunges. These behaviors require acute spatial information, but we know very little about how these spiders perceive depth. In particular, the use of stereopsis by hunting spiders has been largely dismissed; their closely-positioned eyes (<< 1cm separation) are assumed to limit the utility of binocular disparity. However, binocular disparity is dictated by viewing distance, as well as eye separation, and the common dismissal fails to account for the short distances at which these miniature animals interact with their environment. We modeled the binocular disparity between eye-pairs of different hunting spider families viewing targets at behaviorally relevant distances. Our results indicated that some spider species have visual systems that allow them to utilize stereopsis and obtain precise depth information, whereas others do not have high enough acuity to detect small disparities. In fact, the binocular disparities for the stereoscopic species were comparable to those of toads, another non-primate system known to utilize stereopsis. This is a first step in our ongoing efforts to explain depth perception across hunting spiders through morphological and behavioral studies.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 13: Patrice Baumhardt</b><br>Wild-type and domesticated Mallard duck vision: Not all it’s quacked up to be.</summary>

<p>, Purdue University Department of Biological Sciences</p>
<p>The use of domesticated avian model species (e.g. Chicken and Pigeon) have been used prevalently in the literature to characterize the vision of all birds within their clade. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated revealing there is a large amount of variation in the anatomical and physiological properties between different avian species visual systems. Are model species in the literature representative of their clade or even their own species in its wild-type form? We characterized the visual system of adult Mallard ducks, both in the wild-type form (Anas platyrhynchos) and the domesticated form (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus). We found differences in eye size, visual pigment sensitivity, oil droplet absorbance, and the relative density of the photoreceptors across the retina between the two forms. Behavioral studies are needed to confirm how these visual system characteristics could affect the behavior of the wild-type and domesticated mallard, but our findings indicate that caution is needed when characterizing a wild species’ visual system based entirely on its domesticated form.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 11: Julia K Vrtilek</b><br>Social Information in the Contact Calls of Common Vampire Bats</summary>

<p>Grace Smith-Vidaurre (Rockefeller University, University of Cincinnati) and Gerald G. Carter (The Ohio State University, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute)</p>
<p>When adult common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are socially isolated, they produce contact calls. These calls contain enough information for individual recognition and can attract past food-sharing partners. However, it remains unclear whether vampire bat contact calls also contain other social information. Other bat species have been shown to produce learned vocalizations that convey group identity and allow them to recognize unrelated groupmates. To identify what social information vampire bat contact calls contain, we recorded more than 800,000 contact calls made by 76 individuals from seven colonies. To determine pairwise vocal similarity, we used 27 spectral and temporal measures of calls to classify calls to bats. We then asked whether calls contained three types of social information by testing whether multivariate acoustic distance was predicted by kinship (based on known maternities and 17 microsatellite markers), familiarity (time spent together in captivity), and the strength of social bonds (rate of food sharing). Our preliminary results indicate that call similarity is higher in kin (vs nonkin), pairs from the same wild colony (vs different colonies), nonkin pairs from distant sites housed together in captivity (vs pairs that did not meet), and nonkin that share food (vs nonkin that did not). These results are consistent with vocal convergence during social bond formation.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 15: T Christopher Brown</b><br>Critical Period Plasticity Exchanges Neurons Active in Visual Circuitry</summary>

<p>AW McGee University of Louisville</p>
<p>Abnormal visual experience during a developmental critical period can yield enduring deficits in visual function. Yet how experience-dependent plasticity alters the properties of individual neurons and composition of visual circuitry are unclear. Here we measured with calcium imaging how monocular deprivation during the critical period disrupts binocularity for thousands of neurons in visual cortex. Tracking the tuning properties of nearly a thousand neurons revealed that abnormal vision interconverts monocular and binocular neurons to alter eye dominance through the ratio of monocular neurons. In addition, some neurons more responsive to the deprived eye were silenced and previously unresponsive neurons were recruited. Thus, plasticity during the critical period adapts to recent experience by both altering the tuning properties of responsive neurons and exchanging neurons active in visual circuitry.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 9: Sanjay Prasher</b><br>Exploring the factors underlying social competency in foragers using an agent-based model</summary>

<p>Elizabeth A. Hobson, University of Cincinnati</p>
<p>Social connectedness allows animals to benefit from conspecifics (e.g., by gaining valuable information from knowledgeable individuals). Socially competent animals should affiliate more with informed individuals to increase the chances of benefiting from their activity. We used an agent-based model to evaluate how access to a food resource impacts an informed agent’s social centrality when conspecifics have varying degrees of social competence. We modeled foraging on a food patch, which only an informed individual can activate, and tested how attention (probability of perceiving successful foragers), preference (probability of approaching successful foragers), and memory (number of time steps remembered) affected foraging success. To understand whether these parameters may underlie social competency, we compared the foraging success of non-producers and the producer’s strength in a proximity network between simulations with different combinations of parameter values. This modeling approach will serve as a useful tool in understanding the potential cognitive mechanisms underlying social competency and producing predictions for empirical work.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 3: Lauren R. Brunner</b><br>Let’s get physical: Physical Enrichment Alters Male Mouse Perception of Courtship Rejection Vocalizations</summary>

<p>Aejah M. Van Dyke, Tuskegee University; Dr. Laura M. Hurley, Indiana University</p>
<p>Both sensory and motor environmental enrichment (EE) are often employed in laboratory settings in order to improve animal welfare through promoting more naturalistically complex environments. However, few studies have explored the effects of EE on social communication. Here, we evaluate the effects of both social and physical enrichment on the perception of negatively valenced vocal signals in male house mice. During courtship interactions, female mice produce broadband vocalizations (BBVs, or squeaks), which can be associated with courtship rejection. Male mice produce prosocial USVs in courtship interactions and decrease their USV output in response to BBV playback. In this study, we used a 2x2 experimental design in which mice were either in social housing (S+) or isolated housing (S-), and either physically enriched housing (P+), or physically deprived housing (P-) for four weeks, creating four distinct groups with varying levels of social and physical enrichment: S+P+, S+P-, S-P+, and S-P-. Mice then underwent a split cage paradigm in which limited contact with a female mouse was allowed through a plexiglass barrier for fifteen minutes during which they were exposed to 5 minutes of silence (baseline), 5 minutes of BBV playback, and another 5 minutes of silence (recovery). USV production was measured to gauge perception of the BBVs. There was a significant effect of both social and physical enrichment level on baseline USV production, with P+ increasing and S+ decreasing baseline USV production. Mice exposed to physical enrichment, regardless of their social enrichment level, also produced significantly longer USVs than physically deprived mice. Physical enrichment also altered mouse perception of courtship rejection signals and the trajectory of vocal behavior during and after BBV playback, with P+ causing a decreased response to playback and decreased recovery after playback. Surprisingly, social treatment did not significantly affect these measurements, suggesting that physical enrichment powerfully alters mouse perception and vocal production in a social interaction, while social enrichment alone does not.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 5: Tim Elmo Feiten</b><br>What Role does the Concept of Umwelt play in Sensory Ecology?</summary>

<p></p>
<p>Jakob von Uexküll (1864 – 1944) coined the concept of Umwelt to talk about the different worlds experienced by animals according to their specific sensory and motor capabilites. He had an important influence on ethology, partly through the work of Konrad Lorenz, and the term Umwelt is still used today in some fields of biology. I want to find out two things: a) How prevalent is the term Umwelt among sensory ecologists today and what do they take it to mean? b) What role does the subjective experience of animals play for sensory ecology in general? My poster poses these two questions to the scientists present at Sensorium 2022 and serves as a general invitation for dialogue about the status of subjective experience in the study of behavior, sensation, and environments. To provide some more structure for possible conversations, the poster summarizes two main lines of historical disagreement about Uexküll’s thought: Do Umwelten belong to individual organisms or to entire species? And is an Umwelt selected from a larger set of pre-existing elements or is it actively constructed by the living subject?</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 7: Aaron Hamrick</b><br>Olfactory Differences Among Closely Related Cactophilic Drosophila Species</summary>

<p>Stephanie M. Rollmann and John E. Layne</p>
<p>Evolutionary divergence of behavioral traits during adaptation to changes in the environment has been well documented in many animals. This divergence is often manifested in sensory systems, for instance, changes in the available host plants leads to shifts in behavioral preference of the insects that exploit them, and changes in the olfactory system that the insects use to identify and locate them. Some progress has been made in understanding the neural basis of such sensory modifications, both within and between Drosophila species. Shifts in host plants have been shown to correspond with changes in the sensitivity and selectivity of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to odor cues and/or changes in the number of select subtypes of OSNs. However, the extent to which such changes are lineage-specific, and thus due more to ancestry than to adaptation, remains to be determined. This research examines odorant responses by OSNs in six closely related pairs of Drosophila species from the Drosophila repleta group that feed and breed on cactus. Results indicate marked differences in neurophysiological response from several study species who have shifted host plant preference from the ancestral cactus – prickly pear – to columnar cactus, or to both the ancestral and new type of cactus, i.e., they have become polymorphic.</p>

  <summary><b>Poster 29: Dilini Karunappuli Herath Mudiyanselage</b><br>Odorant dose-response curves of Drosophila mojavensis olfactory neurons and the divergence of host preference behavior</summary>

<p>John E. Layne, Stephanie M. Rollmann, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA</p>
<p>Animal habitats may contain heterogeneities in important factors such as the plants that are locally available. Animals that specialize on these plants may encounter different plant-derived sensory cues in different locales. Evolutionary adaptation to different plant cues may result in evolutionary divergence, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Divergent traits include behavioral preference for local plants and sensitivity to plant cues in the peripheral nervous system. The cues and sensations involved are primarily chemical and olfactory, the latter initiated by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express odorant receptor genes. The cactophilic fly Drosophila mojavensis occurs as four geographically isolated populations in the deserts of southwestern North America. Each population is an obligate specialist that feeds and breeds on one of four different cactus species. A model for incipient speciation, D. mojavensis has been studied for their olfactory responses (behavioral and neuro-sensory) to odorants, especially cactus-derived volatiles. This revealed differences between the populations in OSN sensitivity which are hypothesized to have arisen due to variation in receptor expression or amino acid sequence, each of which are major ways for species to evolve divergence in sensory capability and behavior. In the present study we characterize the differential sensitivity – adaptive divergence – of D. mojavensis OSNs to a range of concentrations of stimulus odorants, rather than the more typical single concentration. The resulting dose-response curves provide a more definitive measure, compared to single concentrations, of the amount, direction and even the existence of any potential divergence, indicated by a left- or rightward shift of the curve. Also, the slope of the curve shows the binding affinity of the OSNs, which may provide a hint as to the mechanistic cause of the divergence, e.g., difference in receptor expression levels, difference in receptor amino acid sequences.</p>
