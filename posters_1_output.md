  <summary><b>Thomas Myers</b><br>Diversity or oral sensory neuron types in the trigeminal ganglion.</summary>

<p>Joe Breza (University of Eastern Michigan), Robin Krimm (University of Louisville)</p>
<p>The trigeminal ganglion is home to somatosensory neurons whose processes innervate the entire head and neck. To date, little is known about somatosensory neuron types that innervate the oral cavity. Here, I recorded from mechanosensitive and thermosensitive neurons innervating the oral cavity. I found that the tongue was innervated by slow adapting (SA) or rapid adapting (RA) based on their response to force, and further categorized by their conduction velocity. A subset of anterior tongue and lip mechanosensory neurons were optogenetically identified as Parvalbumin+ (Pvalb+). Pvalb+ neurons tended to be fast Aβ, rapidly adapting neurons. To examine the innervation patterns of these neurons, I labeled them at different ages and compared their patterns to other known markers for somatosensory types that innervate tongue. Pvalb+ neurons are not visible until later postnatal ages, they innervate most fungiform papillae. Pvalb+ neurons also innervated fewer filiform papillae than both Neurofilament+ and CRGP+ neurons. In addition, they have distinctive morphological characteristics compared to another later appearing somatosensory population innervating the tongue (vGlut3+ neurons). These findings lay the groundwork for understanding sensory innervation of the oral cavity.</p>

  <summary><b>Olivia Harris</b><br>Characterizing color vision in jumping spiders through unlearned behaviors</summary>

<p>Nuthara Jayasinghe, Jala Reed, Nathan Morehouse - University of Cincinnati</p>
<p>Jumping spiders are highly visual predators that rely on high acuity vision to capture prey. They also exhibit a wide variety of colorful signals employed in courtship. Molecular and physiological evidence suggests the existence of di-, tri-, and tetrachromacy across the family, but behavioral experiments have not interrogated the chromatic capabilities of these animals. Traditionally, evidence for color vision had relied on association-based behavioral trials to demonstrate an animal’s ability to discriminate between wavelengths. However, in many animals, including jumping spiders, such paradigms are laborious or inaccessible. To surmount this, we investigated achromatic and chromatic discrimination in two species of jumping spiders using unlearned behavioral responses. To do this, we characterized chromatic and achromatic contrast thresholds using whole-body responses as well as retinal tracking movements to video playback stimuli. This ongoing work is providing critical evidence of the perceptual abilities of these colorful animals.</p>

  <summary><b>Syeda Farjana Hoque</b><br>Haller’s organ functionality is critical for ticks to detect humidity and prevent dehydration</summary>

<p>Ticks must be able to move into high humidities for water vapor uptake to replenish water stores. If their humidity sensing is impaired, ticks cannot readily move to high humidities, prompting increased death. Here, we examined the ability of American dog ticks to sense humidity by manipulating the Haller’s organ and how altered humidity detection impacts tick survival. Also, Ir93a (an ionotropic receptor linked to humidity detection) expression was examined in the Haller’s organ location (first legs). Either permanent removal or temporary blocking of the Haller’s organ impairs the ability of ticks to rest in areas with high humidity to maintain hydration. Impaired detection of humidity did not impact tick survival when individuals were held under stable, humid conditions, but variable humidity conditions (wet and dry areas) resulted in reduced survival. This increased mortality is likely a combination of increased dehydration stress and rapid utilization of energy reserves required for water vapor uptake. Ir93a is expressed highly in the first legs, suggesting that this receptor is associated with humidity detection. These studies indicate that the Haller’s organ is likely essential for humidity sensing in ticks and a lack of humidity detection lowers tick survival.</p>

  <summary><b>Julia K Vrtilek</b><br>Social Information in the Contact Calls of Common Vampire Bats</summary>

<p>Grace Smith-Vidaurre (Rockefeller University, University of Cincinnati) and Gerald G. Carter (The Ohio State University, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute)</p>
<p>When adult common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are socially isolated, they produce contact calls. These calls contain enough information for individual recognition and can attract past food-sharing partners. However, it remains unclear whether vampire bat contact calls also contain other social information. Other bat species have been shown to produce learned vocalizations that convey group identity and allow them to recognize unrelated groupmates. To identify what social information vampire bat contact calls contain, we recorded more than 800,000 contact calls made by 76 individuals from seven colonies. To determine pairwise vocal similarity, we used 27 spectral and temporal measures of calls to classify calls to bats. We then asked whether calls contained three types of social information by testing whether multivariate acoustic distance was predicted by kinship (based on known maternities and 17 microsatellite markers), familiarity (time spent together in captivity), and the strength of social bonds (rate of food sharing). Our preliminary results indicate that call similarity is higher in kin (vs nonkin), pairs from the same wild colony (vs different colonies), nonkin pairs from distant sites housed together in captivity (vs pairs that did not meet), and nonkin that share food (vs nonkin that did not). These results are consistent with vocal convergence during social bond formation.</p>

  <summary><b>Kelly E. Fredericksen</b><br>An anatomical study of synaptic connections from the chemosensory cortices to the mediodorsal thalamus</summary>

<p>Chad L. Samuelsen, University of Louisville</p>
<p>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) processes and communicates information between cortical areas related to attention, valuation, and stimulus-outcome associations. Recently, we showed that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus encode the sensory and affective properties of intraorally delivered odors, tastes, and odor-taste mixtures. Although traditional tract-tracing studies show that projections from the primary chemosensory cortices for smell and taste (piriform cortex (PC) and gustatory cortex (GC), respectively) overlap in the mediodorsal thalamus, the proportions of neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus that receive direct projections from these cortical areas remains unclear. Using an intersectional viral approach, we found that a greater proportion of neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus receive synaptic connections from the gustatory cortex than from the piriform cortex. Next, we sought to determine the role of the mediodorsal thalamus in consummatory choice. Using a two-bottle brief-access task, we measured preferences for previously experienced odors, tastes, and odor-taste mixtures. Pharmacological inactivation (NBQX) of mediodorsal thalamus significantly reduced consumption during both the odor and taste sessions and eliminated the experience-dependent odor preference for the saccharin paired odor. These anatomical and behavioral findings corroborate that the mediodorsal thalamus plays a key role in the multisensory flavor processing that guides ingestive behaviors.</p>

  <summary><b>James Whitley</b><br>Integration of Cortical and Tectal Inputs in the Pulvinar Nucleus</summary>

<p>Across sensory modalities, the segregation of distinct features of the sensory environment into parallel streams of information has proven a fundamental organizing principle. In the pulvinar nucleus (PUL), extensive reciprocal connections with most visual cortical areas and a lack of clearly defined cell types have made it difficult to link its anatomical organization with functional response properties. However, study of the projections from the superior colliculus (SC) to the PUL can provide a starting point for deciphering how anatomically defined components may be differentially involved in the various functions ascribed to the PUL. Using confocal microscopy, we observed a region occupying the caudal medial PUL that received highly convergent, bilateral projections from SC, whereas a region occupying the lateral PUL received only ipsilateral, topographically organized inputs from SC. Additionally, inputs to these anatomically defined regions showed a high degree of convergence with inputs from both layer 5 and layer 6 cortical neurons and displayed unique short term synaptic plasticity. Our results indicate a surprising level of convergence across anatomically defined PUL regions, highlighting its importance in integrating a diversity of visual information.</p>

  <summary><b>T Christopher Brown</b><br>Critical Period Plasticity Exchanges Neurons Active in Visual Circuitry</summary>

<p>AW McGee University of Louisville</p>
<p>Abnormal visual experience during a developmental critical period can yield enduring deficits in visual function. Yet how experience-dependent plasticity alters the properties of individual neurons and composition of visual circuitry are unclear. Here we measured with calcium imaging how monocular deprivation during the critical period disrupts binocularity for thousands of neurons in visual cortex. Tracking the tuning properties of nearly a thousand neurons revealed that abnormal vision interconverts monocular and binocular neurons to alter eye dominance through the ratio of monocular neurons. In addition, some neurons more responsive to the deprived eye were silenced and previously unresponsive neurons were recruited. Thus, plasticity during the critical period adapts to recent experience by both altering the tuning properties of responsive neurons and exchanging neurons active in visual circuitry.</p>

  <summary><b>Milad Ahmed</b><br>Study of cAMP signaling dynamics in Trypanosoma cruzi life cycle</summary>

<p>Miguel Chiurillo and Noelia Lander</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study is to investigate cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling dynamics in Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This parasite differentiates into four developmental stages to complete its life cycle within an insect vector and a mammalian host. Consequently, the parasite faces extreme environmental changes. The response to these changes is mediated by signal transduction pathways. cAMP is a universal second messenger and previous studies have shown that cAMP levels increase during T. cruzi metacyclogenesis, suggesting a role in T. cruzi differentiation. We used a genetically encoded red fluorescent cAMP indicator (R-FlincA) to generate a cAMP biosensor cell line in T. cruzi. The PCR amplified R-FlincA was subcloned into the T. cruzi expression vector pTREX-n and constructs were used to transfect T. cruzi epimastigotes. Resistant populations were selected and RFlicA expression was confirmed by western blot. We are currently measuring the intracellular cAMP levels in these cell lines under different experimental conditions, using fluorometry and flow cytometry techniques. Subsequently, we will use this biosensor to identify cAMP signaling domains in different developmental stages of the parasite. We anticipate that our results will provide new insights into the role of cAMP in T. cruzi life cycle.</p>

  <summary><b>Dr. Anca Ralescu</b><br>P300-based Brain Computer Interface for the Control of an Assistive Robo</summary>

<p>Madhav Lolla, Sreekar Puchala, Sameer Jadhav, Anh Nguyen, Tian Tan</p>
<p>Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems involving non-invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) are designed to stimulate task-specific electrical signals, analyse, and recognize patterns generated in conjunction with a cognitive task. These patterns can then be used to instruct a physical device (e.g., wheelchairs or robotic systems) to carry out a particular action. Among several BCI paradigms are those based on a positive deflection stimulated and observed in a person's EEG (P300) - generated after they successfully detect a target stimulus presented among concurrent non-target stimuli. While P300-based systems have been employed successfully in spelling tasks, the nature of these experiments facilitates their application in assistive robotic systems designed to carry out tasks such as navigating, grasping, and delivering objects. In this research, we design a P300-based BCI system that can navigate an assistive robot efficiently in an indoor setting. Utilising computer vision, our robot is capable at detecting, identifying objects, grasping, lift, and deliver them to the user. In conjunction with this, we have designed an efficient navigation plan for the robot tailored to the context of target object detection and grasping. We also discuss the implementation of an AI system, a knowledge base of relevant information for objects and locations of interest in the physical space.</p>

  <summary><b>Melissa Kelley</b><br>The loss of a microbiome-derived tRNA modification leads to a phenotype that alters predation of the mosquito Aedes aegypti</summary>

<p>Shubham Rathore (University of Cincinnati), Melissa Uhran (University of Cincinnati), Elke K. Buschbeck (University of Cincinnati), Joshua B. Benoit (University of CincinnatiC)</p>
<p>Transfer RNA (tRNA) bring the amino acid to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Chemical modifications to tRNA are required for proper functioning and accurate translation of messenger RNA codons. Modification to the anticodon influences decoding of codons by the tRNA and thus directly affects protein synthesis. Queuosine (Q) is an anticodon modification required for decoding codons of four amino acids. Q is synthesized in bacteria and eukaryotes have enzymes to salvage it from their microbiome. In mosquitoes, the microbiome affects immune response, environmental changes, and reproduction. Given mosquitoes are unable to synthesize Q, we hypothesized that the microbiome is critical to the maintenance of Q levels. Here, we show that growth of mosquito larvae with a microbiome of only E. coli lacking Q (∆queA) leads to lower Q levels in larval tRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are phenotypic effects on the coloration of ∆queA larvae. Lower Q levels correlate with less pigmentation and likely melanin which is critical to mosquito physiology. Lastly, we evaluate the effects on predation of mosquito larvae by the sunburst diving beetle (Thermonectus marmoratus). Overall, we show that the microbiome composition affects tRNA modification levels which affects phenotypes that alter predation of mosquito larvae.</p>

  <summary><b>Dilini Karunappuli Herath Mudiyanselage</b><br>Odorant dose-response curves of Drosophila mojavensis olfactory neurons and the divergence of host preference behavior</summary>

<p>John E. Layne, Stephanie M. Rollmann, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA</p>
<p>Animal habitats may contain heterogeneities in important factors such as the plants that are locally available. Animals that specialize on these plants may encounter different plant-derived sensory cues in different locales. Evolutionary adaptation to different plant cues may result in evolutionary divergence, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Divergent traits include behavioral preference for local plants and sensitivity to plant cues in the peripheral nervous system. The cues and sensations involved are primarily chemical and olfactory, the latter initiated by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express odorant receptor genes. The cactophilic fly Drosophila mojavensis occurs as four geographically isolated populations in the deserts of southwestern North America. Each population is an obligate specialist that feeds and breeds on one of four different cactus species. A model for incipient speciation, D. mojavensis has been studied for their olfactory responses (behavioral and neuro-sensory) to odorants, especially cactus-derived volatiles. This revealed differences between the populations in OSN sensitivity which are hypothesized to have arisen due to variation in receptor expression or amino acid sequence, each of which are major ways for species to evolve divergence in sensory capability and behavior. In the present study we characterize the differential sensitivity – adaptive divergence – of D. mojavensis OSNs to a range of concentrations of stimulus odorants, rather than the more typical single concentration. The resulting dose-response curves provide a more definitive measure, compared to single concentrations, of the amount, direction and even the existence of any potential divergence, indicated by a left- or rightward shift of the curve. Also, the slope of the curve shows the binding affinity of the OSNs, which may provide a hint as to the mechanistic cause of the divergence, e.g., difference in receptor expression levels, difference in receptor amino acid sequences.</p>

  <summary><b>Sophia Clemen</b><br>Testing for individually-recognizable vocal signatures in Northern Bobwhite quail</summary>

<p>Sanjay Prasher (graduate student), Claire O’Connell (graduate student), Elizabeth Hobson (principal investigator)</p>
<p>The Northern Bobwhite quail, Colinus virginianus, is a species of great conservation concern, with Ohio populations experiencing greater than a 97% decrease in numbers since the 1970’s. Wild populations in Ohio are currently monitored with automated sound recording units. Our goal is to test whether male “bob-white” calls are individually distinctive and could be used to better estimate population sizes, habitat fidelity, and movement patterns. Previous studies have shown that Bobwhite quail differ in the structure of their separation calls, but whether the loud territoriality calls are individually distinctive is unknown. To test this, we recorded calls from 12-20 male Bobwhite which were placed in individual sound recording chambers. We analyzed: (1) whether male “bob-white” calls were consistent within individuals and (2) whether calls were distinctive across individuals. We analyzed characteristics of call spectrograms using the R package warbleR. Results of this study could have strong conservation implications and could be used to better understand and manage threatened populations of wild quail.</p>
